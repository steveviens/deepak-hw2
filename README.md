# Homework Assignment 2

## Assignment

Implement a photo album web application that can be searched using natural language through both text and voice. You will learn how to use Lex, ElasticSearch, and Rekognition to create an intelligent search layer to query your photos for people, objects, actions, landmarks and more.

## Outline

This assignment has eight components:

1. Launch an OpenSearch Instance
2. Upload & Index Photos
3. Search
4. Build the API Layer
5. Frontend
6. Implement Voice accessibility in the frontend
7. Deploy your code using CodePipeline
8. Create AWS CloudFormation template for the stack


## 1. Launch an ElasticSearch instance

- Using AWS ElasticSearch service2, create a new domain called “photos”. 
- Make note of the Security Group (SG1) you attach to the domain.
- Deploy the service inside a VPC3.  
-- This prevents unauthorized internet access to your service.
